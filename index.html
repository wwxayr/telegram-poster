        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
Digital messaging platforms are increasingly integrated into higher education, influencing both communication and independent learning practices. This study examines how Telegram channels and bots function as academic tools supporting interaction and self-directed learning among university students. Using a mixed-methods design that combined an online survey questionnaire (n = 23) and semi-structured focus group responses, the research explores communication efficiency, learning support, and perceived challenges. Findings show that Telegram improves access to academic information, supports independent learning through automated bots, and enables continuous interaction between students and lecturers. At the same time, students report challenges such as information overload and lack of structured organization of learning materials. Overall, Telegram functions as an informal learning infrastructure in higher education, but its effectiveness depends on structured implementation and student self-regulation.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
Digital communication technologies have become central to modern higher education. Universities increasingly rely on messaging platforms to distribute learning materials, coordinate academic activities, and support independent study beyond the classroom. Telegram has gained particular popularity because it enables structured channels for information sharing and automated bots that provide reminders, explanations, and learning support.
        </p>
        <p>
Educational chatbots are recognized as tools that enhance engagement and improve access to information (Kuhail et al., 2023; Debets et al., 2025). Studies also show that Telegram-based learning environments improve communication and interaction in academic contexts (Mandalika et al., 2023; Md Yusof & Abdullah, 2025).
        </p>
        <p>
However, limited empirical research examines Telegram as an integrated environment for both communication and self-directed learning across general university settings. This study addresses this gap by investigating how Telegram channels and bots support academic communication and independent learning.

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>
A mixed-methods research design was used. Data were collected through an online survey questionnaire and semi-structured focus group responses. The questionnaire included both closed-ended and open-ended questions measuring frequency of Telegram use, perceived communication effectiveness, and learning support from bots.
        </p>
        <p>
Twenty-three university students participated. Most respondents were aged 18–20 and represented IT-related academic programs. Participation was voluntary and anonymous.
        </p>
        <p>
Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative responses were analyzed thematically to identify patterns in communication and learning experiences.

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
Telegram was used frequently for academic purposes. Thirty-nine percent of students reported daily use and fifty-two percent reported using Telegram several times per week. Telegram channels significantly improved communication, with an average rating of 4.35 out of 5. Clarity of academic information was rated 4.57, and convenience compared to traditional communication systems was rated 4.22.
        </p>
        <p>
Telegram bots supported independent learning and organization of study activities (4.22/5). Students reported that bots help explain academic topics and increase motivation (4.17/5). Key advantages included support for self-study through bots (78%), easy access to learning materials (43%), and fast communication (39%).
        </p>
        <p>
However, students also reported challenges. The most common was lack of structured learning materials (74%), followed by difficulty separating academic and personal messages (61%). Overall, 70% reported a positive impact on academic performance.

        <h2>Discussion & Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
The findings show that Telegram functions as both a communication infrastructure and a learning support environment. Channels enable rapid information exchange, while bots provide automated assistance that supports independent learning.
        </p>
        <p>
These results align with previous research showing that educational chatbots improve engagement and access to information (Kuhail et al., 2023; Debets et al., 2025) and that Telegram enhances communication in learning environments (Mandalika et al., 2023; Md Yusof & Abdullah, 2025).
        </p>
        <p>
At the same time, students reported structural challenges, particularly information overload and weak organization of academic content. These findings suggest that effective use of messaging platforms requires structured instructional design.
        </p>
        <p>
Limitations include small sample size and reliance on self-reported data. Future research should examine long-term academic outcomes and institutional integration strategies.
